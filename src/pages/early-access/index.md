Thank you for requesting early access to Hypertrace. Next step: <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/hypertraceworkspace/shared_invite/zt-fu9lvclw-vG_SI2JgMA72~frFGEPhrg" target="_blank">Join Hypertrace on Slack</a>.  Once in Slack you will download the Hypertrace installation script and Helm chart. You should also visit the '<a href="https://docs.hypertrace.org/getting-started/">Getting Started</a>' section of the Hypertrace Docs for further instructions.

We hope you get as excited about Hypertrace as we are. Whether you have questions or not, let us know what you think in Slack. Together we will build the best distributed tracing platform in the known galaxy.

See you soon!
